#Expense organizer

###Create an app for organizing your expenses. Here are some user stories for you - build one at a time before moving to the next one:

* As a user, I want to enter an expense, so I can keep track of where I'm spending my money. I should be able to provide a description (for example, "Burgers"), an amount ($7.56), and the date I made the purchase.
* As a user, I want to choose a single category for each expense, so I can label out where I'm spending my money.
* As a user, I want to show what percentage of my money I spent in each category, so I can know where I'm wasting all of my money.
* As a user, I want to choose multiple categories for each expense, because life is not so simple.
* As a user, I want to label what company I made each purchase from, so that I can see which companies are profiting from my poor budgeting.
* As a user, I want to see what percentage of each category I spend on each company, so that I can try to figure out where to most easily make a dent in my spending.
* As a user, I want to filter my spending reports by time period, so that I can know how my spending habits have changed over time.
* As a user, I want to set a monthly budget for each category, so that I can create goals for my spending.
* As a user, I want to see if I've exceeded my budget for each category, each month.


Note: We finished building the user interface for adding and viewing. The date format has a blank time for some reason.
