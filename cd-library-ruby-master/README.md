#CD Library

###Goal

3/13/14

Make a program for users to catalog and organize their CDs. They should be able to create a new CD, enter the album name and artist, list out all of their CDs, and search for a CD by album or artist.

Then, add a feature that lets them list out all the artists they have CDs for, and choose an artist to see which CDs by that artist they own.
